# Docs Index

These documents describe the current Codex-first Andrea runtime in this repo.

Current source-of-truth docs:

- [Runtime](RUNTIME.md)
- [Orchestration Contract](ORCHESTRATION_CONTRACT.md)
- [Runtime reality audit](RUNTIME_AUDIT.md)
- [Operations (restarts, services)](OPERATIONS.md)
- [Setup And Requirements](REQUIREMENTS.md)
- [Operator Commands](OPERATOR_COMMANDS.md)
- [Testing And Validation](TESTING.md)
- [Merge Boundary](MERGE_BOUNDARY.md)
- [Debug Checklist](DEBUG_CHECKLIST.md)
- [Current Runtime Spec](SPEC.md)
- [Legacy Reference](LEGACY_REFERENCE.md)

Important:

- The docs listed above are the current source of truth for the standalone Codex/OpenAI runtime.
- The active integration shape is: `Andrea_OpenAI_Bot` owns backend execution truth, while `Andrea_NanoBot` owns Telegram UX and selection state.
- Older NanoClaw-era or Claude-era materials elsewhere in `docs/` are preserved only as legacy reference unless they have been updated to match this runtime.
